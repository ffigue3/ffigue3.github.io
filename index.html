  <h2>I Don’t Use Social-Media, But I’m Not Anti-Social</h2>
  
  <p>I don’t go to social-media,
I write a story about <a href="A Magical Princess from a Normal World.html">Jeatah.</a>
  </p>
 <p>I’m a girl who likes her privacy,
Yet I love to be with my family.</p> 
 <p>I communicate through phone-call,
But with classmates and friends, not at all.</p>  
 <p>I send lists, photos, and messages through text,
If I can’t call, I do that next.</p>
  <p>There are times I do things off-screen,
To be with my family and learn games we’ve never seen.</p>
