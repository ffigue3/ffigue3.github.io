  <h2>A Magical Princess from a Normal World </h2>
  
  <p>Chapter 1 The Day Before Church</p> <p>Once upon a time there lived a 6-year-old Hispanic girl named Jeatah (she has long (dark brown, curly) hair, ocean blue eyes, rose pink lips, and tiny gold hoop earrings that were given to her when she was a baby), who lived with her parents, 2 of her sisters (Gabby and Ninie), and her 2 grandparents (from her mother’s side of the family).<p> <p>Even though, her family love and help her in times of need, most of Jeatah’s life (mainly in school) wasn’t always happy. Thanks to her experience in the schools she went to, she ended up developing autism (which caused her to have stage fright and problems speaking to other people). The only times she felt safe and happy was when she’s with her family (especially on weekends, brakes, and summer vacations). On the weekend before Valentine’s day, Jeatah and her sister were preparing for Valentine's day at their new school, but she felt uncomfortable about the gift she made for her classmates and teachers. “Jeatah, is something wrong?” Jeatah’s mother asked in a gentle voice. Jeatah looked up, star start to her mother’s hazel brown eyes, and said (in a slightly sad and nerves voice) “I’m scared. What if my classmates and teachers might not like the gifts I made for them. What if the other students might make fun of me, like the students in my old schools. What if they might be allergic to...” her mother interrupted and said, “Don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine. This school is not like the others. You class will love the gifts just as much as I love you and your sister, my princess.” She then gave Jeatah a big hug, a few kisses, and carried her to her bedroom.</p> <p>The room was full of fairytale-based items like books, fingerings, DVDs, types, CD’s, snow globes, costumes, and even the bed was designed like fairytale princess bed (with silk/fabric hanging like curtains that surround the bed). Jeatah’s mother tucked Jeatah in and told her to go to sleep, so Jeatah will be well rested for church, since her mother made her promise to perform and sing at the church (which will last form 9:00 AM - 2:00 PM).</p>
 
  <p>Chapter 2 The Magic of the Stars and Moon</p>  <p>That night, the stars and moonlight shines through her bedroom windows, as the stars and snow makes the light shimmer like glitter, some of the light glittered into Jeatah’s eyes (causing her to slowly open her eyes). When she got up, she was awestruck by the stars and moon. She climbs out of her bed and quietly walk to the windowsill and gazed at the night sky (thinking about the magic that she is seeing with her own eyes and forgot about her problems).</p>
<p> Suddenly, enchanting music began to fill the air and she became curious about where the beautiful music is coming from. She then, quietly tiptoeing out her bedroom door, down the hall, (when the clock struck midnight,) quickly but quietly walk down 7 steps and saw the stars and moonlight shimmering and the entire room glittered and light up like magic.</p> <p>On the wall in front of her, a medium sized round mirror (used as a decoration) began to glow and sparkle. While watching in amazement, the mirror transformed by the light of the stars and moon in to and larger mirror with designs that people used in medieval times/fairy tales.</p> <p>Her eyes lit up, she walks slowly towards the mirror, and starting to hear the enchanting music get slightly louder, she discovers that that the music is coming from the mirror. When Jeatah slowly reach with her right hand and touched the mirror by the tips of her fingers, it glowed a blinding light and she fell into the mirror that turns out to be a magical portal to infinite numbers of worlds and realms.</p>

  <p>Chapter 3 The Beginning of New Friendships</p> <p>When her eye began to adjust, she found herself falling hundreds of feet above the ground. She screamed and cried so loud for help that all of the trees, flowers, and all things living in nature worked fast to make a large pile of soft leaves, flowers, and snow so Jeatah can land safely to the ground. A mysterious winged creature with white feathers flew up to catch her, but Jeatah was so scared, she blacked out while the creature was about to catch her. After the mysterious creature caught her, he flew to a clearing in the forest (were the plants and animals were making the pile) and gently placed Jeatah on top of the pile like it was a soft bed for her to sleep in.</p> <p>While the sun was shining in Jeatah’s eyes, she began to slowly open them. The mysterious creature spoke with a soft, gentle voice “Don’t worry, you are safe here.” “Huh, What? Who are you?” said Jeatah (still blinded by the sunlight and was unable to see the creature's face). “A friend.” said the mysterious creature. Jeatah smiled (because something about the creature made her feel safe and calm) and when she closed her eye for a moment, the mysterious creature walks towards a thick part of the forest and slowly disappear in the shadows of the trees. While the creature was beginning to disappear, Jeatah got afraid again and got up quick while saying “Huh, Where are you going? Will I ever see you again? Please don’t leave me alone.” She looked around the clearing and notice that the sun was about to rise (even though she remembered that it was supposed to midnight and knows that the sun rises 4-7 hours after midnight), the snow is not as cold as the snow in her world, it’s still winter but there are plants and flowers growing like as if it’s spring or summer, and that she’s surrounded by animals that seem friendly.</p> <p>A bunny and a deer moved slowly to the girl while a small butterfly fluttered and a small bird gently flew towards her. “Hello.” said the butterfly (speaking to Jeatah) in a soft voice. “Are you ok?” the bird asked. “Who are you?” the bunny asked. “Where did you come from?” the deer asked. Jeatah got very surprised by what she’s hearing and said “Oh, y-you can talk!” A gentle and sweet voice spoke and said “Of Course we can talk…” “Huh” Jeatah said while a beautiful white horse walked into the light and in front of her.</p> <p>The beautiful horse is actually an alicorn (half unicorn and half pegasus) who use her magic horn to make all humans see her as a normal horse. Only special people who earns her trust and friendship are able to see her as who she really is. The alicorn continued to speak and said “...but very few humans can hear us, while many of them just stare and most of the time try to harm us like as if we can’t understand what they say, see us as if we have no feelings and no intelligence.” Jeatah got confused and said “I’m sorry, but I don’t understand how I could/can understand what you’re saying! The last thing I remembered it/was that I was at home looking at the night sky, then all of a sudden music was playing. I tried to find where the music was coming from, and after that I end up falling from the sky. And last time I check, I don’t understand what animals say back home!” “I see, but you can still understand what I’m saying…” said the alicorn. Jeatah realized something and said “Oh, sorry for been rude, but I just remembered that I didn’t really tell you and the animals my name, where I come from or even ask you for your name.” The alicorn agreed, laughed a bit, and told Jeatah that her name is Amalfia. “I’m Jeatah and I’m from Bensenville.” said Jeatah. Amalfia and the other animals got both confused and curious at the same time. “Bensenville? Where’s that?” asked Amalfia. “It’s in Illinois.” Jeatah answered. “Where’s Illinois?” Amalfia asked. “In North America.” Jeatah answered. “Where’s North America?” Amalfia asked. Jeatah looked around, began to feel a little bit sad (but didn’t shed a tear), then look up at Amalfia and said, “I’m guessing nowhere near here.” All of the animals looked down (in sadness) and a tear or 2 shed from their eyes of the thought that Jeatah might be far away from home and the people she loves and that she must have missed them but doesn't show it. </p> <p>Amalfia stopped crying, tried to look calm (as if she wasn’t crying), and said “Well, you are free to live in our forest for as long as you want. Until we find a way to get you back to your home, you will be treated like you are one of us.” Jeatah smiled gave Amalfia a hug and said, “Thank you”. All of the animals cleared up, some of the baby animals invited Jeatah to play with them, and some of the grown-up animals talked to her so they can get to know each other and teach Jeatah about the forest.</p>

  <p>Chapter 4 A New Home for Jeatah</p> <p>While Jeatah was playing with the baby animals, Amalfia and a lot of the grown-up animals went to the center of the forest (where the forest’s magic is strongest), so they can find a place for Jeatah to live. Amalfia remembered a ruin of an old castle that was nearby. The animals worked very hard to make it comfortable for Jeatah to live in. </p> <p>The bears, bunnies, bees, and squirrels brought honey, nuts, vegetables, and berries, while some of the foxes and wolves ran to the nearest human village to get milk, eggs, wheat, treats, and meat for Jeatah to eat, since they made a vow to never harm fellow creatures of the forest. The birds brought feathers and anything they can find that’s soft to make a bed for her to sleep in. The silkworms and spiders used their silk to make pillows and sheets to keep her warm during cold nights. </p> <p>Amalfia used her horn to cast a spell over the ruin to turn it and some of the plants in to a beautiful castle. The castle’s walls were made of crystals and magic plants to keep it hidden from unwanted guests like hunters, humans who kills innocent creatures for fun, and/or anyone or anything that might harm her. The castle has many rooms that can appear and disappear in case of intruders and will be connected to Jeatah’s imagination, so the rooms can change locations and appearance to make her feel at home (if she imagens her own home and bedroom). </p> <p>While the grown-up animals continued working on make a home for Jeatah, the baby animals notice that Jeatah was humming. “Why are you sounding like a hummingbird?” asked a baby robin. Jeatah looked up to talk to the robin and asked, “What do you mean?” “You were humming something.” said a baby fox. Jeatah cheeks turned as red as raspberries, she placed one hand over her lips, giggled a bit, and said “Oh, I was just humming one of the songs my mommy taught me when I was very little. It’s a song most kids in my culture learn to sing. It’s called Verde Luz, which means Green Light in Spanish.” The baby animals got both confused and cereus. Some of the baby animals asked at the same time “Spanish? What’s Spanish?” Jeatah smiled again and said, “Spanish is one of many other languages that people speak.”</p> <p>The animals understood and asked her to sing the entire song for them. Jeatah agreed to sing the song and sang,</p>

  <p>“Verde luz de monte y mar,</p> <p>isla virgen del coral,</p> <p>sí me ausento de tus playas</p> <p>primorosas,</p> <p>sí me alejo de tus palmas</p> <p>silenciosas,</p> <p>quiero volver, quiero volver,</p> <p>A sentir la tibia arena</p> <p>a dormir en tus riberas,</p> <p>isla mía, flor cautiva</p> <p>para ti quiero tener,</p> <p>Libre tu cielo,</p> <p>sola tu estrella</p> <p>isla doncella, quiero tener,</p> <p>verde luz de monte y mar.” </p>
  
<p>“That’s very pretty, but what does it mean?” asked one of the fawns. </p> <p>Jeatah answered “Well, the English version of the song goes like this:</p>

  <p>Green light of mountain and sea,</p> <p>virgin island of coral,</p> <p>If I become absent from</p> <p>Your exquisite beaches,</p> <p>If I move away from your</p> <p>Silent palm trees,</p> <p>I want to return,</p> <p>I want to return,</p> <p>To sleep on your riverbanks</p> <p>My island,</p> <p>Captive flower,</p> <p>For you I want to have,</p> <p>Your sky freed,</p> <p>Your star alone</p> <p>Servant island,</p> <p>I want to have,</p> <p>Green light</p> <p>Of mountain And sea.”</p>
  
<p>“That’s a pretty song.” said one of the butterflies. “What is your culture?” asked one of the bunnies. Jeatah smiled and told the animals as much as she could about her family and her family’s culture. She explained that her family’s blood and skin color is a merge between 3 different cultures (Taino native color, African black, and Spanish white) and how that happened. </p>
<p>Amalfia calls out in a kind voice “Jeatah, I’m sorry for interrupting your fun, but I think you should come with us to get to your new home. It’s also starting to get dark, which means that it’s time for the baby animal to go home and get ready for bed.”, while she and the other grownup animals walk towards Jeatah and the baby animals. The baby animals began to complain and Jeatah got curious about where she’s going to live until they find a way to return her to her family. Amalfia allowed Jeatah to ride on her back to get to the castle. While Jeatah was riding Amalfia, her eyes opened wide and shimmered like as if stardust sparkle in them in amazement while seeing all of the beauty of the forest and told Amalfia “You and the other animal must be very lucky that you guys live in a beautiful place that’s not polluted by the garbage people make and it feels like there is a kind of magic that makes it so wonderful that it feels like a dream that I’m not sure that I want to wake up at all.” “That very sweet of you to say. Thank you, but you make the forest sound so perfect that there aren't any problems at all.” said Amalfia. “Well isn’t it?” asked Jeatah in a joyful voice. “Not exactly.” said Amalfia. “What do you mean not exactly?” asked Jeatah in a confused voice. “Never mind. Let’s just get to your new home. I hope you’ll like it.” said Amalfia, while worrying about Jeatah’s safety and how she’ll feel after learning the truth about most the humans of this world that come to the forest. Jeatah got confused and curious, but she remained silent the rest of the way to the castle. When they got to the castle, Jeatah was so surprised, she was speechless. “Here we are, Jeatah. Your new home.” said Amalfia. “Wow! It’s incredible! Are you shore this castle is for me? It looks like the kind of place that real princesses live in!” said Jeatah in an excited and amazed voice. “Yes, it’s your new home. The creatures of the forest and I worked very hard to fix it and make it as comfortable as possible. Allow me to show you around the castle.” Jeatah gave Amalfia a big hug and said “Yes. Thank you.” When Amalfia was done showing Jeatah around the castle and told her all about it, she led Jeatah to her room to change from the clothes for she was wearing to one of the silk gowns that the spiders and silkworms made for her. </p>
<p>When Jeatah was dressed in a shimmering blue and white nightgown, Amalfia shoved her to her bed and spoke like a caring mother by saying “Ok Jeatah, it’s time for you to go to bed and sleep. Good night.” When Jeatah got on the bed and wasn’t looking, Amalfia cast a magic spell over her so she would sleep pleasantly. Amalfia than whispered in Jeatah's ear and said "Dear child, I hope you'll never have to suffer as so many have when the humans of this world entered our forest. It's a bit funny for I felt in my heart as if you’re a fellow creature of the forest and as if we're sisters. For even though, you just came here from this morning, the forest and its creatures felt a strong connection toward you and I can tell that you felt the same way. Someday, when you get a bit older you'll learn who I really am." </p> <p>When Amalfia left the room, a shadowy figure wearing a black cloak (the mysterious creature who saved Jeatah’s life) appeared from the window and entered the room to get closer to Jeatah to whisper in her ear. The mysterious creature said "Don't be afraid of any danger you'll face. I promise, I shall protect you, but in the shadows. So, when your alone in the darkest of night or fear the darkness, remember that you also have friends in the shadows of the night." and then flew out the window, while not realizing that he had left a single white feather (from his wing) on the windowsill. </p>
 
  <p>Chapter 5 The Magic of a Caring Heart</p> <p>When Jeatah woke up the next day, she found the feather that the mysterious creature left on the windowsill. When she gently grabbed the feather and wondered where it came from, she suddenly remembers something she heard last night. After changing her nightgown for a white and silver silk dress (the dress covered her from a few inches lower from her knees to her shoulders and with sleeves that cover half of her arms) and eating some of the nuts and berries that her animal friends got her, she went outside to talk to someone about what happened. </p> <p>While realizing that everyone was still sleeping (back at her house (with her family), (whether it’s on school days or on weekends) she always ends up waking up before everyone else and a few minutes before the sunrise), she saw an old woman with a rusted metal jug walking towards her. “Dear child, what are you doing in the forest this early in the morning?” the old woman asked Jeatah. Jeatah didn’t answer, for she was taught by her family to never talk to strangers.</p> <p>“Pardon me for asking, but would you care to gather some water from the river for an old woman as myself? Please” the old woman asked. Jeatah didn’t answer, but she gently placed the feather on her hair like how Native Americans put eagle feathers on their heads and helped the old woman. The old woman hand Jeatah the jug when they got to the nearest river. </p> <p>Jeatah grabbed the jug, washed it in the river until it’s clean, and gathered some of the cleanest water from a deep part of the river. When she scooped up the water, the jug shimmered like as if it was made from the purest silver, she carefully hands it to the old woman. “What a kind and sweet girl you are. For that, you deserved a gift, Jeatah.” said the old woman. Jeatah was in shock, when the old woman spoke her name. “How did you know my name?” Jeatah asked in a surprised voice. “I’ve always known it. You’re the daughter of the king and queen of 2 kingdoms. Your family are gifted by being one of many families who are part human and part magical creatures.” answered the old woman. “What are you talking about? My parents aren't royals of any kingdom! My mom is a teacher for preschoolers who can’t speak English! My dad is a master sergeant in the U.S. Army!” Jeatah said. “I know, but that’s only half true. I understand that you probably have a lot of questions about this, but let's just find out what gift should I give you.” said the old woman in a calm voice. Jeatah then said “No, that won’t be necessary. I just ...” but before she could finish, the old woman’s whole body began to glow until a big burst of light (coming from the woman) caused the woman into a small fairy. </p> <p>The fairy had butterfly shaped wings that shimmered in the light of the first ray of sunlight, a dress that would appear almost like a rose, and is around the same age as Jeatah’s own mother. while fluttering around Jeatah, she said (in a soft voice) “Hmm. Now let's see here. I know. For you have the gifts your whole family blessed you with but was unable to unlock them. The gift I’ll give you is to help you learn about who you really are by unlocking a part of one of your blessings. Now whenever you sing you’ll touch the hearts of all who hears your lovely voice.”</p> <p>When the fairy began to disappear, Jeatah ran as fast as she could to get back to the castle. But when she was halfway to the castle, she noticed a shadow (of the mysterious creature) waving his hand right next to her shadow. When Jeatah stopped to look up and saw the mysterious creature (she still didn’t see his face because the trees were covering it). Without speaking (for an unknown reason), he led her to 3 little girls and 2 slightly older boys crying (in a very thick part of the forest) because they were lost and want to go home. </p> <p>She was still feeling shy, so she only peaked in the distance and heard everything they said. “Stop crying!” said one of the boys. “We shouldn’t have left to find it!” cried the youngest girl. “It’s May 23, our parents wedding anniversary!” said the other boy. “And we agreed to surprise them with a party, wild berries, and wild flowers.” said the eldest girl when she was calming down. When Jeatah heard one of the boys mentioned the date, she instantly remembers her parents and began to feel homesick because her parent’s 15th wedding anniversary is also on May 23.</p> <p>The mysterious creature notice Jeatah’s sorrow (he also knows about what happened between Jeatah and the fairy because he was spying on her a few minutes before she met the fairy disguised as an old woman), so he picked a leaf and wrote with a stick “Sing one of the songs that’s in your heart. A song that has the power to open a person’s heart, give/strengthens a person’s inner strength, or even to help you and the other children feel better.” he then let the leaf gently fall like a feather in front of Jeatah. She read the note and with confusion she began to sing. </p> <p>The song she sang both helped her and the children. “What a beautiful sound.” said of the boys. “Where is it coming from?” asked the girl who is slightly older than the youngest girl. The children look around them until the eldest girl saw Jeatah’s shadow and the feather in her hair while it shines like a star in the darkness. “Hey guys, look over there. Someone’s watching us. It looks like a girl.” said the eldest girl. When Jeatah realized that she was seen, she ran away. “Let’s follow her. she might know the way out of the forest.” said the youngest girl. When Jeatah realized that the feather was shimmering, and the children are following it and her voice, an idea came to her. </p> <p>She took off the feather, tide it to a single strand of her long hair, carefully pulled it out of her head, grab a fallen branch (it was twice as long as her height and light enough for her to carry it by one edge by one hand), and tide the other end of the strand on one end of the branch. She then held the branch up like a huge cat toy and (while staying hidden in the trees and bushes) continued singing to lead the children out of the forest (yesterday, while she was falling from the sky, she remembered seeing parts of the forest that act like landmarks that’ll help her (a little bit) to navigate through the forest). Some of the plants moved aside to make a path and when they were close to the edge of the forest, Jeatah through the branch like a sphere and the children followed the feather out of the forest. With a sense of happiness in her heart for helping the children out of the forest, she walks back to the castle hoping to see her family again and wonder about the many adventures that might come her way, who was the mysterious creature that saved her life, and what the fairy told her. </p> <p>When she got to the castle, she decided to not tell anyone the whole story about what happened to her. Because some of the things she was think about (during her trip back to the castle), she realized that there are a lot of things that she feels that she should find out herself. She was beginning to believe the fairy when she said that Jeatah has many questions, but the 2 biggest questions she have (so far) were “What did that fairy mean when she said that the facts about my parents are only half true?” and “Why did the fairy made it sound like I was born as a powerful magical princess of this world? When, last time I checked, I was born in Chicago and move to Bensenville as a US citizen.” </p>
